# STQA-MiniProject_1
This is a simple JavaFX based desktop application. The motive behind creating this application is to perform applicable Junit testing along with deep exploration of JavaFX GUI framework. 
This project is based on tracking College on-campus drives which includes their date of drive, ctc, company name and eligibility criteria which is displayed in a tabular fashion.
This application allows student to login and apply for his/her desired company drive by simply clicking on that drive's row in the table. 
The admin has the proviledge to add new drives, delete finished drives, add new students and delete students from the database.
This project is a perfect depection of a typical on-campus training and placement portal. Junit test cases will be soon applied to rudimentary scenarios.
